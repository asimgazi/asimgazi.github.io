I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in Computer Science and Statistics at Harvard University. My interdisciplinary research is on closed-loop control systems for intelligent mobile health (mHealth) interventions. I conduct use-informed research to enable sensor-informed, personalized mHealth interventions, digital health interventions that can be delivered during everyday life that are personalized to an individual's biobehavioral state inferred from mobile, wearable, and ubiquitous, sensor signals. My vision is for the models, data analytics, and algorithms I work on to enable these intelligent mHealth interventions to complement the personalized support we obtain from clinicians, synchronous support we can only avail for less than 1% of our lives (e.g., one hour per week via psychotherapy). 

My postdoctoral fellowship is advised by Susan A. Murphy, and I am currently funded by a ~$1M K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), which will provide up to $747k of research funds over the first three years of my assistant professorship at whichever institution I join. I am very fortunate to have been previously supported by Schmidt Sciences, in parternship with the Rhodes Trust, as one of 32 Schmidt Science Fellows selected from around the world in 2023. I completed my Ph.D. with Omer T. Inan and Christopher J. Rozell in electrical engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship. 

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
