**I am a postdoctoral fellow in computer science and statistics at Harvard University**, advised by [Susan A. Murphy](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/). I completed my Ph.D. in electrical engineering in 2023 from the Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by [Omer T. Inan](https://irl.gatech.edu/people/) and [Christopher J. Rozell](https://siplab.gatech.edu/people.html/).

I am currently funded by a ~\\$1M NIH K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), which will fund the remainder of my postdoc and up to [&#36;747k over my first three years as an assistant professor](http://bit.ly/43uk7xN) at whichever institution I join. Previously, I was supported by Schmidt Sciences, in partnership with the Rhodes Trust, as [one of 32 Schmidt Science Fellows selected from around the world](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/fellow/asim-gazi/) in 2023. My PhD was funded by a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship.

Outside of research, I am a [Pathfinder for Boston Partners in Education](https://bostonpartners.org/educators/pathfinders/). If you are interested in having me visit your middle or high school  and speak to your students, please feel free to reach out! You can read about one of my past visits [here](https://bostonpartners.org/asim-gazi-gardner-pilot-academy/). I am also the founder and owner of [Internet of Tutors LLC](https://www.internetoftutors.com/).

## Research Interests
The future of [mobile health (mHealth)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHealth) lies in delivering personalized healthcare support during everyday life to help prevent and treat chronic diseases, leveraging wearable sensors and other ubiquitous digital health technologies for real-time feedback. My interdisciplinary research aims to close the gap in accessible, everyday healthcare support that is personalized to individuals —- support that is currently left unaddressed by traditional healthcare systems that rely on synchronous clinical support (e.g., psychotherapy once a week for one hour that accounts for less than 1% of an individual's life). I develop data analytics, models, and algorithms for [closed-loop control systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-loop_controller) that tailor mHealth interventions to a person’s dynamically changing biobehavioral context. My [use-inspired research](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/12015/chapter/5) benefits greatly from collaborations with clinician scientists who then take the lead on translational research efforts for clinical impact. This includes clinical trials of nascent mHealth interventions I have worked on, which have led to outcomes such as [Breakthrough Designation](https://research.gatech.edu/research-georgia-tech-and-emory-university-leads-fda-breakthrough-designation-new-ptsd-treatment) of non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation for patients with posttraumatic stress disorder by the the US Food and Drug Administration.

My technical research focus is specifically on state estimation, dynamic modeling, and closed-loop control for this next generation of intelligent mobile health (mHealth) interventions. I develop data-driven dynamic models and uncertainty-informed control algorithms that are tailored to mHealth interventions (e.g., non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation via earbuds), leveraging inductive biases to enhance sample efficiency. My research on sensor informatics includes signal processing, machine learning, and uncertainty quantification algorithms that leverage domain knowledge to track latent state dynamics such as changes in stress.
