I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in Computer Science and Statistics at Harvard University, advised by [Susan A. Murphy](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/). I am currently funded by a ~\\$1M NIH K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), which will fund the remainder of my postdoc and up to [\\$747k over my first three years as an assistant professor](http://bit.ly/43uk7xN) at whichever institution I join. Previously, I was supported by Schmidt Sciences, in partnership with the Rhodes Trust, as one of 32 [Schmidt Science Fellows](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/fellow/asim-gazi/) selected from around the world in 2023.

My interdisciplinary research is on closed-loop control systems for intelligent mobile health (mHealth) interventions. I conduct use-informed research to enable sensor-informed mHealth interventions, digital health interventions that can be delivered during everyday life that are personalized to an individual's biobehavioral state. I work on (1) the data analytics, signal processing, and machine learning algorithms to infer biobehavioral state dynamics from the raw signals obtained using mobile, wearable, and ubiquitous, sensors, the (2) dynamic models and digital twins to characterize and predict the effects of potential interventions on changes in biobehavioral state, and (3) the decision-making and data-driven control algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning) to make intelligent intervention decisions based on inferred changes in an individual's biobehavioral state.

My work specifically addresses three key technical challenges:

I. Significant uncertainty in sensor-informed decision making

II. The need for personalized modeling and decision-making

III. Lack of quantitative, mechanistic models in psychophysiology

My vision is for the models, data analytics, and algorithms I work on to enable these intelligent mHealth interventions to complement the personalized support we obtain from clinicians, synchronous support we can only avail for less than 1% of our lives (e.g., one hour per week via psychotherapy). Along these lines, I am very fortunate to work with amazing collaborators on translational research and real-world deployments and clinical trials, which has led to impact such as FDA Breakthrough Designation for a nascent non-invasive neuromodulation intervention that my PhD focused on dynamically modeling the effects of. 

I completed my B.S. in electrical engineering with a minor in mathematics in 2018 there at the University of Texas at Dallas, funded by the Academic Excellence Scholarship. I then completed my Ph.D. in electrical engineering with a minor in biomedical engineering in 2023 from the Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Omer T. Inan and Christopher J. Rozell and funded by a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship.

I am currently a Pathfinder with the Boston Partners in Education. If you are interested in having me visit your middle or high school class, please feel free to reach out! You can read about one of my past visits [here](https://bostonpartners.org/asim-gazi-gardner-pilot-academy/). I am also the owner of [Internet of Tutors LLC](https://www.internetoftutors.com/), which I founded in 2017 during my undergraduate years in Dallas, TX. 

You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
