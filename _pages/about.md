I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in Computer Science and Statistics at Harvard University, fortunate to be advised by Susan A. Murphy. Given the current funding climate, I am incredibly grateful to be funded by a ~\$1M K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), which will provide up to \$747k of research funds over the first three years of my assistant professorship at whichever institution I join. I also had the privilege of being previously supported by Schmidt Sciences, in partnership with the Rhodes Trust, as one of 32 Schmidt Science Fellows selected from around the world in 2023. 


My interdisciplinary research is on closed-loop control systems for intelligent mobile health (mHealth) interventions. I conduct use-informed research to enable sensor-informed mHealth interventions, digital health interventions that can be delivered during everyday life that are personalized to an individual's biobehavioral state. I work on (1) the data analytics, signal processing, and machine learning algorithms to infer biobehavioral state dynamics from the raw signals obtained using mobile, wearable, and ubiquitous, sensors, the (2) dynamic models and digital twins to characterize and predict the effects of potential interventions on changes in biobehavioral state, and (3) the decision-making and data-driven control algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning) to make intelligent intervention decisions based on inferred changes in an individual's biobehavioral state.

My work specifically addresses three key technical challenges:

I. Significant uncertainty in sensor-informed decision making

II. The need for personalized modeling and decision-making

III. Lack of quantitative, mechanistic models in psychophysiology

My vision is for the models, data analytics, and algorithms I work on to enable these intelligent mHealth interventions to complement the personalized support we obtain from clinicians, synchronous support we can only avail for less than 1% of our lives (e.g., one hour per week via psychotherapy). Along these lines, I am very fortunate to work with amazing collaborators on translational research and real-world deployments and clinical trials, which has led to impact such as FDA Breakthrough Designation for a nascent non-invasive neuromodulation intervention that my PhD focused on dynamically modeling the effects of. 

I graduated with my Ph.D. in electrical engineering in 2023 from the Georgia Institute of Technology, having benefitted from the advisorship of Omer T. Inan and Christopher J. Rozell and funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship. I completed my B.S. in electrical engineering in 2018 from the University of Texas at Dallas, funded fully by the Academic Excellence Scholarship and benefitting from research experience in Carlos Busso's lab.
