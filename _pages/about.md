**I am a postdoctoral fellow in computer science and statistics at Harvard University**, advised by [Susan A. Murphy](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/). I completed my Ph.D. in electrical engineering in 2023 from the Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by [Omer T. Inan](https://irl.gatech.edu/people/) and [Christopher J. Rozell](https://siplab.gatech.edu/people.html/).

I am currently funded by a ~\\$1M NIH K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), which will fund the remainder of my postdoc and up to [&#36;747k over my first three years as an assistant professor](http://bit.ly/43uk7xN) at whichever institution I join. Previously, I was supported by Schmidt Sciences, in partnership with the Rhodes Trust, as [one of 32 Schmidt Science Fellows selected from around the world](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/fellow/asim-gazi/) in 2023. My PhD was funded by a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship.

Outside of research, I am a [Pathfinder for Boston Partners in Education](https://bostonpartners.org/educators/pathfinders/). If you are interested in having me visit your middle or high school class, please feel free to reach out or visit their website! You can read about one of my past visits [here](https://bostonpartners.org/asim-gazi-gardner-pilot-academy/). I am also the founder and owner of [Internet of Tutors LLC](https://www.internetoftutors.com/).


#### Research Summary
To help prevent and treat chronic diseases, I work on the next generation of intelligent [mobile health (mHealth)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHealth) interventions that provide personalized healthcare support during everyday life, leveraging wearable sensors and other ubiquitous sensor technologies for real-time feedback. My interdisciplinary research addresses the dire need for personalized healthcare support during everyday life -- support that is currently left unaddressed by traditional healthcare systems that rely on synchronous clinical support (e.g., weekly psychotherapy that accounts for less than 1% of one's life). As an engineer with interdisciplinary research training, my [use-inspired research](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/12015/chapter/5) focuses specifically on the data analytics, models, and algorithms that enable [closed-loop control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-loop_controller) for mHealth interventions -- sensor-informed decision-making to help adaptively tailor mHealth support to a personâ€™s dynamically changing biobehavioral state. To learn more, visit my [Research](/research/) page.

Through collaborations with clinician scientists, my translational research has also led to clinical impact. Our collaborative research with the Emory School of Medicine formed the scientific basis in 2022 for [US Food and Drug Administration Breakthrough Designation](https://research.gatech.edu/research-georgia-tech-and-emory-university-leads-fda-breakthrough-designation-new-ptsd-treatment) of non-invasive vagus nerve sitmulation, a nascent mHealth intervention, for patients with posttraumatic stress disorder.
